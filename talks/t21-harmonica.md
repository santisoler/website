## About

In this tutorial weâ€™ll take a tour around Harmonica, a Python library for
forward modelling, inversion and processing gravity data, focusing on the
processing workflow. We will start with a real dataset of scattered gravity
observations and finally produce a regular grid of the Bouguer gravity
disturbance. We will accomplish this by following these steps:

* Load the gravity dataset.
* Compute gravity disturbance by removing the normal gravity through Boule.
* Project the data to plain coordinates.
* Load a digital elevation model (DEM) of the survey area.
* Compute Bouguer gravity disturbance by forward modelling the topography with prisms.
* Interpolate the Bouguer gravity disturbance onto a regular grid at a constant
  height through the equivalent layer technique.
* Obtain the Bouguer gravity disturbance on a profile using the same equivalent layer.
