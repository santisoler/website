# About

In this talk I present some of the tools we have in [Fatiando
a Terra](https://www.fatiando.org) to the Geophysical Inversion Facility group
from the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, University of
British Columbia.

This talk was based on the [/presentations/gsh2021] talk.

# Live-coding notebook

During the presentation we gave a small demo with live coding following a
[notebook for processing gravity data with Fatiando tools](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fatiando/2021-gsh/HEAD?filepath=demo.ipynb).
