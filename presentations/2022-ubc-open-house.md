# About

The UBC-GIF Open House was a great opportunity to introduce the new GIF team to
researchers, faculty members, geoscientists in the industry and the general
public.
In this talk I cover some of my background with highlights of my research
during my PhD, introduce [Fatiando a Terra](https://www.fatiando.org) and its
relation with research, and talk a little about the current research I'm doing
in my Postdoc in UBC around carbon mineralization.
