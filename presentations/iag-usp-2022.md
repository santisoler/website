# Abstract

In this talk I take the opportunity to unravel my career path, to take
a retrospective look on how I got into geoscience and scientific software
development, and what motivated me through this road.
As being involved in the Fatiando a Terra project, I showcase some of the tools
we develop in it, showing how they support my scientific research, how it
feedbacks from it, and highlight the importance of its community.
Finally, I will peak into what the future of science empowered with open-source
software could look like and how we can start making the change today.
