# Abstract

Carbon mineralization in ultramafic rocks has been proven to be one of the ways
of sequestering CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere to mitigate climate change
effects and limit global temperature increases to values compatible with life
on Earth as we know it.
The sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> in ultramafic rocks takes place during
reactions between minerals rich in Mg, like brucite and serpentine, and
CO<sub>2</sub>-bearing fluids.
The results of these reactions are carbonate minerals that trap the
CO<sub>2</sub> in a geologically and chemically stable form.
Such Mg-rich minerals are present in higher concentrations in ultramafic rocks
that have undergone serpentinization.
Serpentinized rocks tend to have higher concentrations of these Mg-rich
minerals as compared to the unaltered and carbonated ones.
This means that serpentinized rocks have greater sequestration potential than
their unaltered and carbonated counterparts.

The physical properties of ultramafic rocks undergo measurable changes during
serpentinization and carbonation reactions.
Serpentinized ultramafic rocks have a lower density and tend to have higher
magnetic susceptibility than their unaltered and carbonated counterparts.
These changes in their physical properties open the opportunity to apply
geophysical techniques to map the spatial distribution of serpentinized rocks
and estimate their sequestration potential.

We applied 3D geophysical inversion on airborne gravity gradiometry and
magnetic data over the Crawford Nickel Sulphide Project (north of Timmins,
Ontario, Canada) to obtain 3D models of the density and magnetic susceptibility
distributions of the subsurface.
We integrated these recovered models to estimate the carbon sequestration
potential of the rocks.

We applied independent Tikhonov inversions to both the gravity gradiometry and
magnetic datasets along with a joint Petrophysically-Guided Inversions (PGI).
We trained a regression model to predict spatial distributions of Loss of
Ignition (LOI) values in the subsurface from the inverted results of density
and magnetic susceptibility.
The LOI works as a proxy variable for alteration levels:
unaltered ultramafic rocks have low LOI values (<5%), followed by serpentinized
rocks with high sequestration potential (between 10% and 13%), and carbonated
rocks with even greater LOI values (>14%). The estimated LOI values obtained
after the inverted 3D models can be used as a metric to infer the alteration
levels of the rocks and their location in the subsurface.

The recovered 3D model of LOI is in good agreement with LOI estimations
obtained from physical property observations carried out in borehole samples.
These results show that 3D inversions of gravity gradiometry and magnetic data
are a viable technique to characterize the sequestration potential and the
spatial distribution of ultramafic rocks in the subsurface.
Geophysical data acquisition and 3D inversions can be used as a meaningful
source of knowledge that can complement the geologic exploration, drilling
planning phases, and decision-making for carbon sequestration feasibility in
a given area.
