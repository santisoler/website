# About

We were invited by [Agrogeo24][agrogeo24] to give a workshop about
[SimPEG][simpeg], to show the agrogeophysical community how we can use SimPEG
to run forward simulations of DC resistivity data (ERT), and how we can invert
that type of data.

I really enjoyed how warm and welcoming this community is, and spending those
days in Zürich was a lovely opportunity to connect with professionals working
on similar problems but with very different applications.

If your interested in getting hands on the notebooks we wrote for the tutorial,
you can them along with instructions on how to set up your system to run them
in the repo we created for it:
[simpeg/agrogeo24](https://github.com/simpeg/agrogeo24).
