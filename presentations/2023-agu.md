# Abstract

The Fatiando a Terra project is a collection of open-source Python libraries
for geophysics that covers a wide range of functionalities, from data download
and processing to modelling and inversion. Each of the libraries in the project
was designed with their own scope of applications.

Harmonica is focused on processing and modelling gravity and magnetic data. It
provides tools for gravity corrections like Bouguer and terrain effects;
interpolations and upward continuation through equivalent sources; Fourier
domain filters like vertical derivatives, upward continuation and reduction to
the pole; forward modelling of geometries like prisms, point sources and
tesseroids. Boule hosts reference ellipsoids useful for applying coordinate
conversions and normal gravity calculations. Verde offers tools for processing
and interpolating any type of spatial data through a diverse set of methods,
with a machine learning inspired approach. Pooch eases the process of
downloading and caching data from the web with a simple interface. Lastly,
Ensaio offers a set of curated open-licensed datasets useful for teaching,
practicing and probing our codes.

The project started in 2010 in South America as a simple Python library as part
of a PhD Thesis, and has since grown to include a global community of
contributors. Its progress has been facilitated by a consistent effort of
meeting the highest standards in software development. Through the adoption of
best practices and a thoughtful design of its tools, the project provides well
tested and well documented code that is easy to use, regardless of the Python
skills of its users. This has led the project to be used in real world
applications like scientific research and geophysical exploration within
industry and academia.

During this presentation we'll provide an overview of the tools in the Fatiando
project, demonstrate their functionalities for processing of gravity and
magnetics data, and take a look at some code snippets to showcase its
capabilities and ease of use.
