# Abstract

The [Fatiando a Terra](https://www.fatiando.org) project is a collection of
open-source Python libraries for geophysics which cover a range of
functionalities, from data download and processing to modeling and inversion.
In this opportunity we will present the two libraries that are focused on
potential fields: Harmonica and Boule. Boule implements reference ellipsoids
(including oblate ellipsoids, spheres, and soon triaxial ellipsoids),
conversions between ellipsoidal and geocentric spherical coordinates, and
normal gravity calculations. The latter are performed using analytical
expressions for gravity fields at any point outside of the ellipsoid. Harmonica
provides tools for processing, forward modelling, and inversion of gravity and
magnetic data. We will demonstrate its use to compute Bouguer gravity
disturbances by forward modelling the topography with prisms, removing a 2nd
order regional trend, and interpolating it onto a regular grid at a constant
height using the equivalent layer technique. Both libraries are still evolving
as we continue to refine their goals and scopes. We invite everyone to get
involved in the development, whether it's through coding, writing
documentation, or giving feedback.

# Live-coding notebook

During the presentation we gave a small demo with live coding following a
[notebook for processing gravity data with Fatiando tools](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fatiando/2021-gsh/HEAD?filepath=demo.ipynb).
