# About

[![Screenshot of the blogpost](/images/2023-egu-blogpost-fatiando.png)][blogpost]

I was invited by [Constanza Piceda][constanza] to write a [blogpost][blogpost]
about [Fatiando a Terra][fatiando] and the value of open-source software in the
scientific community. She not only invited me, but also edited the blogpost,
doing a magnificent job at improving my very formal writing and keeping it more
casual.

I invite you to [read it here][blogpost]!

Here is the summary she wrote for opening the blogpost:

> A day in the life of a Geophysicist often involves engaging in tasks such as
> data downloading, processing, modeling, or some type of inversion.
> Unfortunately, these tasks are often burdensome or limited to closed-source
> software solutions. The Fatiando a Terra projects aims at overcoming some of
> these difficulties by offering a completely open-source Python toolbox
> tailored for Geoscientists. This week, Santiago Soler, a postdoc at
> University of British Columbia and one of the main software developers, will
> guide us through the world of Fatiando, providing insights into its
> capabilities and sharing how you can actively participate and contribute to
> this exciting project.
