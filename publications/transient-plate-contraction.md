# Abstract

Plate kinematic reconstructions show that the Farallon-Phoenix (Aluk) spreading
center subducted under South America sometime between the Late Cretaceous and
the Paleogene periods. Geological studies have supported a ridge-trench
interaction in Patagonia during Paleocene to Eocene times mostly based on the
documentation of slab window magmatism and Andean arc-quiescence.  However, a
revision of most recent works dealing with the Paleogene tectonic evolution of
Central Patagonia between 39 °S to 50 °S highlights inconsistencies in this
model. Particularly, the existence of two discrete areas with simultaneous slab
window-related magmatism separated by a sector with plate-wide contraction,
along with a spatio-temporal mismatch between magmatism location and ridge
kinematics, preclude a single ridge-trench interaction. With the purpose to
better understand this complex tectonic setting, we integrated this updated
geological evolution into a plate kinematic model. We propose that the oblique
collision of a segmented Farallon-Phoenix/Aluk mid-ocean ridge would explain
the latitudinally vari- able tectonomagmatic evolution of Patagonia during
early Paleogene times.  Finally, this work adds resolution to geodynamic
processes in active margins where complex midocean ridge-trench interactions
take place.
